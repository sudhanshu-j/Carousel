        The universe is all of space and time and their contents. It comprises
        all of existence, any fundamental interaction, physical process and
        physical constant, and therefore all forms of energy and matter, and the
        structures they form, from sub-atomic particles to entire galaxies.
        Space and time, according to the prevailing cosmological theory of the
        Big Bang, emerged together 13.787Â±0.020 billion years ago, and the
        universe has been expanding ever since. Today the universe has expanded
        into an age and size that is physically only in parts observable as the
        observable universe, which is approximately 93 billion light-years in
        diameter at the present day, while the spatial size, if any, of the
        entire universe is unknown..<a

              The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a
              massive, hot ball of plasma, inflated and heated by energy
              produced by nuclear fusion reactions at its core. Part of this
              energy is emitted from its surface as light, ultraviolet, and
              infrared radiation, providing most of the energy for life on
              Earth. The Sun has been an object of veneration in many cultures.
              It has been a central subject for astronomical research since
              ancient times..<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun"

            <div class="text">
              Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the
              Solar System. In English, it is named after the Roman god
              Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce and communication, and the
              messenger of the gods. Mercury is classified as a terrestrial
              planet, with roughly the same surface gravity as Mars. The surface
              of Mercury is heavily cratered, as a result of countless impact
              events that have accumulated over billions of years. Its largest
              crater, Caloris Planitia, has a diameter of 1,550 km (960 mi) and
              one-third the diameter of the planet (4,880 km or 3,030 mi).
              Similarly to the Earth's Moon, Mercury's surface displays an
              expansive rupes system generated from thrust faults and bright ray
              systems formed by impact event remnants..<a

              Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a rocky planet with
              the densest atmosphere of all the rocky bodies in the Solar
              System, and the closest in mass and size to its orbital neighbour
              Earth. Orbiting inferiorly (inside of Earth's orbit), it always
              appears close to the Sun in Earth's sky, as either a "morning
              star" or an "evening star". While this is also true for Mercury,
              Venus appears more prominent, since it is the third brightest
              object in Earth's sky after the Moon and the Sun. Venus has
              historically been a common and important object for humans, in
              both their cultures and astronomy..<a

              The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It orbits at an
              average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi), about 30 times
              Earth's diameter. The Moon always presents the same side to Earth,
              because gravitational pull has locked its rotation to the planet.
              This results in the lunar day of 29.5 Earth days matching the
              lunar month. The Moon's gravitational pull and to a lesser extent
              the Sun's are the main drivers of the tides..<a

              Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical
              object known to harbor life. This is enabled by Earth being a
              water world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid
              surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its
              global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2%
              of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the form of
              continental landmasses within one hemisphere, Earth's land
              hemisphere. Most of Earth's land is somewhat humid and covered by
              vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts
              retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and
              atmospheric water combined. Earth's crust consists of slowly
              moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges,
              volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth has a liquid outer core that
              generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting most of the
              destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation..<a

              Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. The surface of Mars is
              orange-red because it is covered in iron(III) oxide dust, giving
              it the nickname "the Red Planet". Mars is among the brightest
              objects in Earth's sky and its high-contrast albedo features have
              made it a common subject for telescope viewing. It is classified
              as a terrestrial planet and is the second smallest of the Solar
              System's planets with a diameter of 6,779 km (4,212 mi). In terms
              of orbital motion, a Martian solar day (sol) is equal to 24.5
              hours and a Martian solar year is equal to 1.88 Earth years (687
              Earth days). Mars has two natural satellites that are small and
              irregular in shape: Phobos and Deimos..<a

              Gm) with an orbital period of 11.86 years. Jupiter is the third
              brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon
              and Venus, and it has been observed since prehistoric times. It

              ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter, which in

              retrograde rotation period of 17 hours and 14 minutes. This means
              that in an 84-Earth-year orbital period around the Sun, its poles

              Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun. It
              is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter, the
              third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17
              times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than fellow ice
              giant Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus
              because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of
              its atmosphere. Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it
              has no well-defined solid surface. The planet orbits the Sun once
              every 164.8 years at an orbital distance of 30.1 astronomical
              units (4.5 billion kilometers; 2.8 billion miles). It is named
